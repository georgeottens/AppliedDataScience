## Writing Paper
This chapter will consist of elucidations on my contribution to the final paper.

Written:
- Results: SARIMA model section
- Conclusion: SARIMA model section/General conclusion
- Final check for the entirety of the Paper

### Results
In this chapter I stated the most important results I have found forming the SARIMA model.
The paper does not include my other models because they did not contain any relevant data/predictions and conclusions.

### Conclusion
In this chapter I wrote my conclusions and findings of the results from the SARIMA model.
The other part of the conclusion consists of the conclusions of the MultiVariate Linear Regression model.

### Final Check
The final check of the paper was done with all the groupmembers to try and find any mistakes in spelling or conclusions to modify these errors.
