Knock-Out Criteria:
1. The contents of your personal portfolio reflect your contribution to the project, your abilities and what you have learned.
2. Portfolio consists of materials that you either realized individually, or in case of a group effort, a clear statement of what your contribution is in this group effort.
3. The (digital) portfolio is written in a very easily accessible way
4. The main document is a reader's guide (index) that shortly introduces your contributions and links to pages where the contributions are described in detail
5. Every contribution should be accessible from the reader's guide in a single click
6. Consists of links to the Python Notebooks or other evidence material about your contribution on the project that you have finished yourself

Intro:
This is my Personal Portfolio after following the minor Applied Data Science at the The Hague University. It will consist of different chapters on my work, my group work and various assessments explained.
This Minor consists of six different projects which are related to real life data problems.
The timespan of the projects were from September 2020 to January 2021.
Every group has its own project-owner; the person who works at the concerned company.
The group I was in was called the Parcel group, which consisted of five other students, all from different kinds of studies and nearby cities.
Our project-owner is called Tim Ottens and he works at PostNL, the largest parcel-delivery company in The Netherlands.

Research Project
1. Task Definition
Clearly described context (reason and problem definition) and research questions that are reasonable given context
2. Evaluation
Given several clear and motivated directions for future work
3. Conclusions
Discussed results, illustrated by examples(qualitative analysis), answers original research questions based on findings in study, tested outcomes for statistical significance
4. Planning
Planned research project in a good, agile and efficient way


Predictive Analytics
1. Selecting a Model
Supported model selection with references from literature
2. Configuring a Model
Explains why configuration is reasonable (for instance using relevant literature)
3. Training a Model
Taking appropriate countermeasures to prevent under- and overfitting and tunes hyperparameters
4. Evaluating a Model
Comparing several models and additionally explains the differences between models
5. Visualizing the outcome of a model (explanatory)
Visualizing results both quantatively in a plot and where applicable qualitatively using examples


Domain Knowledge
1. Introduction of the subject field
written a good and complete introduction of subject field
2. Literature Research
Found enough relevant literature and all in-text literature references and bibliography are present
3. Explanation of Terminology, Jargon and Definitions
Explained all important and all relevent terminology, jargon and definitions


Data Preprocessing
1. Data Exploration
Properly examined and visualized data, distributions, outliers, correlations and using analysis to give directions for an ealry hypothesis
2. Data Cleansing
Cleansed data in a good and sufficient way
3. Data preparation
Prepared data in an appropriate way, where necessary transforming data, removing outliers, filling in missing values etc.
4. Data visualization
Correctly visualized data in support of decisions made for learning model


Communication
1. Presentations
Prepared or gave more than two (internal/external) solid presentations
2. Writing Paper
Made a lot of effort on writing the paper


Link to Python Notebooks


List the tickets from the Scrum backlog that you have worked on, linked to deliverables, own experiments, etc.


Add any other assignment you feel is evidence of your abilities
