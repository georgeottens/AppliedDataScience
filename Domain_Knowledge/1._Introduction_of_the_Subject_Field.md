### 1. Introduction of the subject field

This project consist of a research project that arose from a problem with PostNL explained earlier in this portfolio.
PostNL wants to predict the number of packages for a certain customer based in their past data.
With this project I have tried to predict these numbers with the coding program Python.
Being familiar with Python is recommended when starting this project, as I struggled in the beginning with no knowledge whatsoever.
The project has to be answered and concluded with a kind of predictive model for a certain customer.

During this project I looked around for any other projects like this one to see how they have managed to form a conclusion.
With these past projects I can adapt my own planning to fit the most efficient way of working to achieve a well structured conclusion.
