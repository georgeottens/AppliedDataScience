### 5. Data visualization
After I concluded that the SARIMA model was the best model for me to use and apply on the dataset, I found the most efficient way of making a prediction with this model was to split the dataset in the train-, validation- and testsets.

Because I needed to compair the model with the multivariate linear regression model, I selected the same distribution of the dataset for the three sets accompanied with their respective percentages relating the dataset:
- `train = ['2015-01-01':'2018-01-01']` (60%)
- `validation = ['2018-01-01':'2019-01-01']` (20%)
- `test = ['2019-01-01':'2020-01-01']` (20%)

As can be seen, the trainingset is 3 years, and both the validation as the testset is 1 year.
These are the same dataset-sizes as the ones used in the multivariate linear regression model.
I thought having the validation- and testset the same size was key, because I could optimize the model for the validationset, before applying it to the testset.

The way I split the data in these sets for customer 69 looks as [follows](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Python_Notebooks/SARIMA_model_klant_69_datasplits.ipynb).
