### 2. Data Cleansing
The data provided by PostNL was already very clean when it was received. 
To prepare the data in a sufficient way and to be able to use it for applying models, as stated in the previous paragraph, one customer was selected.
Because customer 69's 2015-01-01:2016-01-01 was very confusing and did not show any trends what so ever, this year was filtered out of the dataset.

The [data](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/ScreenShots/customer_69_table.png) became more clear after these selections.
After that, the data was able to be prepared for applying models.
