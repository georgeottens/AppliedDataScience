### 2. Data Cleansing
The data provided by PostNL was already very clean when it was received. 
This means that NaN values were not present and the model could start receiving data in this way.

Due to the Covid-situation I decided along with my groupmembers to take out 2020 out of the dataset, as the influences of Covid-19 affected the models' predictions.
This was also done with PostNL's approval.

Due to the fact I did not have to clean the data in any other way I was able to start the data preparation.
