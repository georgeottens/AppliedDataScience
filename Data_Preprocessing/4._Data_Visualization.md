### 4. Data visualization
After choosing the SARIMA model as best model, visualization is necessary to be able to explain the model's findings and to conclude if the model did well or not.
Therefore the best visualization is the one where you can see the real data 2018-01-01:2019-01-01 with the predicted values of 2018-01-01:2019-01-01.
The model has not seen that data yet, so it predicts based on the 2 years before.
