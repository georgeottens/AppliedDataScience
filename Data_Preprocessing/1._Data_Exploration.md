### 1. Data Exploration
The provided data was given as a [csv-file](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/ScreenShots/300_customer_view.png).
The dataset consists of historical data from 300 customers.

I did not know how to make a kind of function that would predict all the customers most optimal, so I selected one customer at random.
I filtered out all the other customers so that only the data from customer 69 was left.
Because the data is just numbers, it was difficult to interpret the trends of this customer.

To help solve this issue, I made a graph of the [customer's data](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Python_Notebooks/Data_klant_69_overzicht.ipynb).
Many datapoint were at zero in the weekends, and I delt with it explained in the sub-chapter data preparation.

When I first looked at this graph, I noticed that the data from 2015 did not follow the same kind of patterns in the next four years.
Thinking of an early hypothesis, I expected the number of packages to follow the same trends as in 2016 to 2019, as 2015 did not seem to have a clear pattern.
These trends mean some peaks around the beginning and end of the summer, plus the peaks around Christmas.
Because internetshopping is getting more popular by the year, I expect to see the same trends, but with a higher amount of packages.
