### 1. Data Exploration

With provided data from more than 300 customers, it was difficult to experiment with predictive models.
The provided data was given as a [csv-file](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/ScreenShots/300_customer_view.png).

To start with exploring the data, one customer was selected to do exploring on.

When visualizing the given data for customer 69, it might be a little unclear on how the data actually looks like.
Because its a large dataset with every weekend zero packages, it looks like a line thats filled underneath [like such](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Python-Graphs/customer_69_data_with_weekends.png).
Some patterns did show relating to date, because around Christmas time, you can see peaks every year.
An early hypothesis is that this trend relating Christmas will continue in the oncoming years.
