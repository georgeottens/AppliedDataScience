### 3. Data preparation
To be able to predict the number of packages in a sufficient manner, weekends were removed from the dataset.
The weekends were removed because every weekend had 0 processed packages, and dealing with zeros, the model predicted worse on weekdays.
Transforming this data into a [graph](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Python-Graphs/customer_69_data.png) and [its code](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Python_Notebooks/Data_klant_69_overzicht_zonder_weekend.ipynb) resulted in a more clear line than with weekends [included](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Python-Graphs/customer_69_data_with_weekends.png)/[(Code)](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Python_Notebooks/Data_klant_69_overzicht.ipynb).

There was no missing data fortunately, so the data was ready to be modelled.
