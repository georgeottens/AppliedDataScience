### 3. Data preparation
As stated in the data exploration sub-chapter, I removed the weekends from the dataset of customer 69 to show a [better pattern](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Python_Notebooks/Data_klant_69_overzicht_zonder_weekend.ipynb).
This is not an issue according to PostNL, because this customer has zero packages every weekend and with exceptions the customer will contact PostNL about this.

The next few steps will show how I realized the preparation of the data before applying a predictive model.
It will show how I selected customer 69 and a total dataset of 2015-01-01 to 2020-01-01.

To use commandos relating different packages, I had to import the packages first;
````
# Import Packages
import pandas as pd
from pandas import datetime
from datetime import timedelta
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import warnings; warnings.simplefilter('ignore')
````

The next step was to load the provided customer data into the Python notebook;
````
# Read CSV file
df_postnl = pd.read_csv('/datc/parcel/notebooks/data/postnl/20201014_300_klanten.csv', parse_dates=[0], index_col=[0])
````

At this stage the customer was ready to be selected as-well as the filtering of the weekend;
````
cust_filter = data['cust_id'] == 'klant_69'
date_filter = data['procesdag'].dt.dayofweek <= 4
data = data.where(date_filter & cust_filter).dropna()
````

The final step for preparing the data was to select data of 2015-01-01 to 2020-01-01;
````
data['procesdag']=pd.to_datetime(data['procesdag'])
data = data.set_index(data.procesdag, drop=True)
data = data['2016-01-01':'2020-01-01']
````

At this point I was able to put the data into a model to compose a prediction for the validation- and testset.
After applying these preparations to the dataset for multiple times I could apply it faster than before.
