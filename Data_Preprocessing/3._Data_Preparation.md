### 3. Data preparation
As stated in the data exploration sub-chapter, I removed the weekends from the dataset of customer 69 to show a [better pattern](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Python_Notebooks/Data_klant_69_overzicht_zonder_weekend.ipynb).
This is not an issue according to PostNL, because this customer has zero packages every weekend and with exceptions the customer will contact PostNL about this.

At this point I was able to put the data into a model to compose a prediction for the validation- and testset.
