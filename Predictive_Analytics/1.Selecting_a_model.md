### 1. Selecting a Model

While searching for applicable models, it was necessary to analyse the given data first to see what type of data it was.
The data turned out to be Time Series, so the models needed to be Time Series models or a different kind of model which would also be applicable for the dataset.
After finding [a list](https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-forecasting-methods-in-python-cheat-sheet/) of most common and most used Time Series models, I made a selection of models that looked as to be most applicable and most useful for our provided data.

Based on looking into the [5 most common](https://www.iunera.com/kraken/big-data-science-intelligence/time-series-and-analytics/top-5-common-time-series-forecasting-algorithms/) Time Series forecasting models, I tried applying the AR, ARMA, ARIMA and SARIMA to the dataset.

The order of models is based on the extensitivity of them.
The AR starts rather simple, because it only takes the given data without and parameters.
With the next models every model goes a bit further in what they take for the predictions.

This way of applying models was very useful for me, because at the start of this project I had no experience whatsoever with programming.
Starting of with a simple model worked for me to understand the basics, and after that expanding my knowledge.
