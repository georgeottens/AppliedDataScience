### 1. Selecting a Model

While searching for applicable models, it was necessary to analyse the given data first to see what type of data it was.
The data turned out to be Time Series, so the models needed to be Time Series models or a different kind of model which would also be applicable for the dataset.
After finding [a list](https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-forecasting-methods-in-python-cheat-sheet/) of timeserie-models, a selection of models was made to be applied to our own data.

This is where the AR, ARMA, ARIMA and SARIMA models came from, because these were some of the [most common](https://www.iunera.com/kraken/big-data-science-intelligence/time-series-and-analytics/top-5-common-time-series-forecasting-algorithms/) Time Series forecasting models.
Also these models seemed to be working great with the featured data.
