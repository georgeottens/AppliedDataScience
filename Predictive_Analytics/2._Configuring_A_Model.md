### 2. Configuring a Model
Configuration of the model is important.
Using a different configuration may result in a model that is not optimally used.
This can lead (relating to Time Series Forecasting Models) to a prediction that is not even close, just because the configuration is not what it is supposed to be.

If you don't know how to select the most optimal one right away, different configurations can be formed to show different results.
Checking the RMSE or the R^2 can give a reasoning on what the best configuration is.

Different models require different configurations. How to configure the SARIMA model and the most optimal configuration for this project is stated in the [next sub-chapter](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Predictive_Analytics/3._Training_a_Model.md).

Other Time Series models that were made during this project were configured almost the same as the SARIMA model;
- AR: `AR(train_data)`
- ARMA: `ARMA(train_data, AR, MA)`
- ARIMA: `ARIMA(train_data, AR, I, MA)`

The AR, I and MA statements consisted of numbers varying from 0 to about 2 or 3.
