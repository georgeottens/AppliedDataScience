### 2. Configuring a Model
Configuration of the model is important.
Using a different configuration may result in a model that is not optimally used.
This can lead (relating to Time Series Forecasting Models) to a prediction that is not even close, just because the configuration is not what it is supposed to be.

In the beginning of configuring a model, I did not know how to do this properly.
This is when I thought of trying different configurations for the model and checking the RMSE or the R^2 for selecting the best configuration.
This way of selecting the most optimal configuration came out as the best solution for me.

Different models require different configurations. How I configured the SARIMA model and found the most optimal configuration for this project is stated in the [next sub-chapter](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Predictive_Analytics/3._Training_a_Model.md).

Other Time Series models that I made during this project were configured almost the same as the SARIMA model;
- AR: `AR(train_data)`
- ARMA: `ARMA(train_data, AR, MA)`
- ARIMA: `ARIMA(train_data, AR, I, MA)`

The AR, I and MA statements consisted of numbers varying from 0 to about 2 or 3. Trying all the different combinations of these numbers I selected the most optimal one for each model and looks like the following;
- AR: `AR(train_data)`
- ARMA: `ARMA(train_data, order=(6, 6))`
- ARIMA: `ARIMA(data_diff, order=(1, 1, 0))`
