### 5. Visualizing the outcome of a model (explanatory)
The best model qualitatively is the one were all the possible parameters were in use. The [SARIMA model with a rolling window](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Python-Graphs/SARIMA_Rolling_Window.png) and [its code](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Python_Notebooks/SARIMA_model_klant_69_rolling_window_werkelijk.ipynb) while using real values had this statement.
This model had a `train_data = data['2016-01-01':'2017-01-01']` and a `val_data = data['2018-01-01':'2019-01-01']`.
It came out as the best predictive model for the used dataset.
This is although the RMSE is higher then the other models, PostNL has more use in this model then the other ones.
