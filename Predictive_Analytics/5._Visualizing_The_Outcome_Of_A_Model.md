### 5. Visualizing the outcome of a model (explanatory)

The results I found from the different models were as such;
- [Code AR](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Python_Notebooks/AR_model_klant_69_werkelijke_aantallen_1_maand.ipynb)
- [Code ARMA](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Python_Notebooks/ARMA_model_klant_69.ipynb)
- [Code ARIMA](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Python_Notebooks/ARIMA_model_klant_69_YEET.ipynb)
- [Code first prediction SARIMA](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Python_Notebooks/SARIMA_model_klant_69_YEET.ipynb)
- [Code plitting SARIMA](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Python_Notebooks/SARIMA_model_klant_69_train_val_test_optimaliseren.ipynb)
- [Code Rolling Window validationset SARIMA](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Python_Notebooks/NEW_SARIMA_model_klant_69_rolling_window_werkelijk_Validatie.ipynb)
- [Code Rolling Window testset SARIMA](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Python_Notebooks/NEW_SARIMA_model_klant_69_rolling_window_werkelijk_Test.ipynb)

As stated in the last previous sub-chapter, my knowledge of coding was poor in the beginning.
When I compared these models I could already see that the models except the SARIMA model took little input to change the predictions.
I discussed the results with my groupmembers and PostNL and thats why I continued with the next model in line instead of trying to apply different methods like cross-validation or such, because I did not know these methods excisted.

Also when I met with the teachers and PostNL, they vaguely suggested that the SARIMA model, was indeed the best model to apply when considering only the Time Series models mentioned.
I think it was okay to try out coding with the less extensive models, because it still helped me understand coding better, so I was ready to apply different kind of techniques to the SARIMA model.

Concluding all these models, the SARIMA with real values and a Rolling Window came out as the best model for my dataset.
This came clear by coding and meeting with PostNL to discuss the results and this model is the model that PostNL desires.
To see these models with their specifications with the different sets and the results in RMSE and R^2, click the last two links above.
