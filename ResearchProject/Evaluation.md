### 2. Evaluation
Given several clear and motivated directions for future work

When this project is completed, there is a specific kind of model which will predict the number of parcels for a certain amount of time.
The accuracy of the model is yet to be defined.

Future work might find a different kind of predictive model, which will predict the number of parcels even better.
This can be an excisting model, but ofcourse also a newly formed model.

The goal however, will not change; predicting a number of packages that need to be processed.
I explicitly leave out saying the prediction for the next day, because the prediction can also be formed for a larger timescale, for instance a week or a month.

The steps to achieving this prediction will not change.
First theres the literature study, after that the coding itself, and ofcourse last but not least, the evaluation of the outcomes.
