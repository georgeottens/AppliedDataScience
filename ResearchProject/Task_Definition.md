### 1. Task Definition
PostNL is the biggest parceldelivery company in The Netherlands.
With customers all around the world the number of packages that need to be processed can go to over a million packages per day.
This project will only focus on PostNLs dutch customers.
With a high number of customers it is difficult to predict the number of parcels in a fashionable manner.
The company needs sufficient employees and trucks to process and deliver all these packages on time.
A sudden rise in number of packages can result in packages not being delivered on time, because of insufficient process-applications like trucks and employees.
Because of this problem this project has come to life.

*How can PostNL apply machine learning models, to predict the number of packages that need to be processed the next day?*
- What are the most common machine learning models for predicting time series?
- What are the most applicable models for the given data?
- What is the best machine learning model for this assignment?
