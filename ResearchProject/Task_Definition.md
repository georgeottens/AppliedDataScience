### 1. Task Definition
PostNL is the biggest parceldelivery company in The Netherlands.
With customers all around the world the number of packages that need to be processed can go to over a million packages per day.
This project will only focus on PostNLs dutch customers.
With a high number of customers it is difficult to predict the number of parcels in a fashionable manner.
The company needs sufficient employees and trucks to process and deliver all these packages on time.
A sudden rise in number of packages can result in packages not being delivered on time, because of insufficient process-applications like trucks and employees.

A new law that was stated in 2020 defines that a volunteerworker cannot be contacted only a day in advance, but has to be informed three days in advance.
Because of this law this project has come to life.
PostNL tries to apply certain data science predictive models on the data of packages they have collected for 300 customers.

PostNL already has a data-research team for this matter, but a fresh look on the problem always helps.
PostNL has asked to try and find the best solution for this problem.

The following questions has been made by me and the groupmembers to achieve such a result;

*How can PostNL apply machine learning models, to predict the number of packages that need to be processed the next day?*
- What are the most common machine learning models for predicting time series?
- What are the most applicable models for the given data?
- What is the best machine learning model for this assignment?
