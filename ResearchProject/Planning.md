### 4. Planning

*The planning for this project*

The most of the planning for this project was done using [TrelloBoard](https://trello.com/nl). It is a tool that uses specific cards that can be made with any description and devided in different subparts [as such](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/ScreenShots/TrelloBoard.png).
Every week the group met on a monday to discuss the planning for that week what parts needed to be finished.

This was efficient way to construct the planning, because it was always clear what needed to be done for that particular week.
When an assignment arose, it was made into a card and devided amongst the groupmembers.
I was very fond of this way of planning.
Every week I knew what to do and could plan the assignments relating to time accordingly.
The specific cards I have worked on can be found at the end of the readers guide of this portfolio.

On every friday we evaluated the work as in individual assignments and the groupwork on how we felt this week was going.
This evaluation was done with a [retrospective](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/ScreenShots/Retro.png).

In the beginning I thought this retrospective was a little bit useless.
You just state what you did that week and that's it.
But later I saw that it was also a good way of reflecting yourself towards others and giving/recieving feedback.
This helped me to plan the assignments each week not only for my own schedule, but also to help other groupmembers that were waiting for my assignment to be done.
