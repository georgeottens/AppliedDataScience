### 4. Planning

*The planning for this project*

The most of the planning for this project was done using [TrelloBoard](https://trello.com/nl). It is a tool that uses specific cards that can be made with any description and devided in different subparts [as such](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/ScreenShots/TrelloBoard.png).
Every week the group met on a monday to discuss the planning for that week what parts needed to be finished.

On the friday we evaluated the work as in individual assignments and the groupwork on how we felt this week was going.
This evaluation was done with a [retrospective](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/ScreenShots/Retro.png).
