# Intro:
This is my Personal Portfolio after following the minor Applied Data Science at the The Hague University. It will consist of different chapters on my work, my group work and various assessments explained.
This Minor consists of six different projects which are related to real life data problems.
The timespan of the projects were from September 2020 to January 2021.
Every group has its own project-owner; the person who works at the concerned company.
The group I was in was called the Parcel group, which consisted of five other students, all from different kinds of studies and nearby cities.
Our project-owner is called Tim Ottens and he works at PostNL, the largest parcel-delivery company in The Netherlands.

## Research Project
### 1. Task Definition

A [clear description with reason and problem definition and research questions](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/ResearchProject/Task_Definition.md) of this project.

### 2. Evaluation

Motivational [directions](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/ResearchProject/Evaluation.md) for future work.

------------

### 3. Conclusions
Discussed results, illustrated by examples(qualitative analysis), answers original research questions based on findings in study, tested outcomes for statistical significance

[Explanations](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/ResearchProject/Conclusions.md) of various results with illustrations and answers to the original research questions.

------------

### 4. Planning
Planned research project in a good, agile and efficient way

------------

## Predictive Analytics
### 1. Selecting a Model
Supported model selection with references from literature

While searching for applicable models, it was necessary to analyse the given data first to see what type of data it was.
The data turned out to be timeseries, so the models needed to be timeserie-models.
After finding [a list](https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-forecasting-methods-in-python-cheat-sheet/) of timeserie-models, a selection of models was made to be applied to our own data. This is were the AR, ARMA, ARIMA and SARIMA models came from.

-----------

### 2. Configuring a Model
Explains why configuration is reasonable (for instance using relevant literature)

-----------

### 3. Training a Model
Taking appropriate countermeasures to prevent under- and overfitting and tunes hyperparameters

-----------

### 4. Evaluating a Model
Comparing several models and additionally explains the differences between models

-----------

### 5. Visualizing the outcome of a model (explanatory)
Visualizing results both quantatively in a plot and where applicable qualitatively using examples

----------

## Domain Knowledge
### 1. Introduction of the subject field
written a good and complete introduction of subject field

This project consist of applying certain coding/models to excisting data, to predict unknown data in a later stadium.
Some skill of coding and understanding the basics of Python are necessary to achieve results.

----------

### 2. Literature Research
Found enough relevant literature and all in-text literature references and bibliography are present

----------

### 3. Explanation of Terminology, Jargon and Definitions

All the necessary explanations of important and relevent terminology, jargon and definitions to get a better understanding of the project, can be found [here](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Domain_Knowledge/3._Explanation_of_Terminology_Jargon_and_Definitions.md).

## Data Preprocessing
### 1. Data Exploration
Properly examined and visualized data, distributions, outliers, correlations and using analysis to give directions for an ealry hypothesis

----------

### 2. Data Cleansing
Cleansed data in a good and sufficient way

----------

### 3. Data preparation
Prepared data in an appropriate way, where necessary transforming data, removing outliers, filling in missing values etc.

----------

### 4. Data visualization
Correctly visualized data in support of decisions made for learning model

----------

## Communication
### 1. Presentations
Prepared or gave more than two (internal/external) solid presentations

These are PowerPoints given by me:
1. [Powerpoint week 6 Monday](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Presentations/ppt_week_6.pptx)
2. [Powerpoint week 12 Friday](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Presentations/ppt_week_12_vrijdag.pptx)
3. At the 21st of January, our whole group will give a presentation for PostNL itself, to explain our reasonings and findings of the project.

### 2. Writing Paper
Made a lot of effort on writing the paper

-----------

## Link to Python Notebooks

-----------

## List the tickets from the Scrum backlog that you have worked on, linked to deliverables, own experiments, etc.

-----------

## Add any other assignment you feel is evidence of your abilities
