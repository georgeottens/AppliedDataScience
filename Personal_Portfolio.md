# Intro:
This is my Personal Portfolio after following the minor Applied Data Science at the The Hague University. It will consist of different chapters on my work, my group work and various assessments explained.
This Minor consists of six different projects which are related to real life data problems.
The timespan of the projects were from September 2020 to January 2021.
Every group has its own project-owner; the person who works at the concerned company.
The group I was in was called the Parcel group, which consisted of five other students, all from different kinds of studies and nearby cities.
Our project-owner is called Tim Ottens and he works at PostNL, the largest parcel-delivery company in The Netherlands.

## Research Project
### 1. Task Definition
A [clear description](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/ResearchProject/Task_Definition.md) with reason and problem definition and research questions of this project.

### 2. Evaluation
Motivational [directions](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/ResearchProject/Evaluation.md) for future work to achieve further results.


### 3. Conclusions
~~Discussed results, illustrated by examples(qualitative analysis), answers original research questions based on findings in study, tested outcomes for statistical significance~~

[Explanations](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/ResearchProject/Conclusions.md) of various results with illustrations and answers to the original research questions.

XXX

### 4. Planning
The [planning](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/ResearchProject/Planning.md) for this project.

## Predictive Analytics
### 1. Selecting a Model
Making a [selection](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Predictive_Analytics/1.Selecting_a_model.md) for models to be used for this project.

### 2. Configuring a Model
Explains why configuration is reasonable (for instance using relevant literature)

XXX

### 3. Training a Model
[Reasoning](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Predictive_Analytics/3._Training_a_Model.md) on taking measurements to prevent under- and overfitting and tuning hyperparameters.

### 4. Evaluating a Model
Comparing several models and additionally explains the differences between models

XXX

### 5. Visualizing the outcome of a model (explanatory)
Visualizing results both quantatively in a plot and where applicable qualitatively using examples

The best model qualitatively is the one were all the possible parameters were in use. The [SARIMA model with a rolling window](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Python-Graphs/SARIMA_Rolling_Window.png) while using real values had this statement.
This model had a `train_data = data['2016-01-01':'2017-01-01']` and a `val_data = data['2018-01-01':'2019-01-01']`.
It came out as the best predictive model for the used dataset.
