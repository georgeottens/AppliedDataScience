# Minor Applied Data Science Personal Portfolio

**Student Name:** George Ottens   
**Student Number:** 20176147  
**School:** The Hague University


**Minor Supervisors:** 
- Jeroen Vuurens
- Tony Andrioli
- Gerda in 't Veld
- Brain Keijzer
- Ruud Vermeij

# Intro:
This is my Personal Portfolio after following the minor Applied Data Science at the The Hague University. It will consist of different chapters on my work, my group work and various assessments explained.
This Minor consists of six different projects which are related to real life data problems.
The timespan of the projects were from September 2020 to January 2021.
Every group has its own project-owner; the person who works at the concerned company.
The group I was in was called the Parcel group, which consisted of five other students, all from different kinds of studies and nearby cities.
Our project-owner is called Tim Ottens and he works at PostNL, the largest parcel-delivery company in The Netherlands.

## Reflection and Evaluation
1. [Reflection on own contribution to the project](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Reflection-and-Evaluation/Reflection%20and%20Evaluation1.md)

2. [Reflection on own learning objectives](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Reflection-and-Evaluation/Reflection%20and%20Evaluation2.md)

3. [Evaluation on the group project as a whole](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Reflection-and-Evaluation/Reflection%20and%20Evaluation3.md)


## Research Project
### 1. Task Definition

A [clear description with reason and problem definition and research questions](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/ResearchProject/Task_Definition.md) of this project.

### 2. Evaluation

Motivational [directions](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/ResearchProject/Evaluation.md) for future work to achieve further results.


### 3. Conclusions
~~Discussed results, illustrated by examples(qualitative analysis), answers original research questions based on findings in study, tested outcomes for statistical significance~~

[Explanations](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/ResearchProject/Conclusions.md) of various results with illustrations and answers to the original research questions.

XXX

### 4. Planning
~~Planned research project in a good, agile and efficient way~~

[The planning for this project](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/ResearchProject/Planning.md)

## Predictive Analytics
### 1. Selecting a Model
~~Supported model selection with references from literature~~

Making a [selection](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Predictive_Analytics/1.Selecting_a_model.md) for the used models for this project.

XXX

### 2. Configuring a Model
Explains why configuration is reasonable (for instance using relevant literature)

XXX

### 3. Training a Model
Taking appropriate countermeasures to prevent under- and overfitting and tunes hyperparameters

XXX

### 4. Evaluating a Model
Comparing several models and additionally explains the differences between models

XXX

### 5. Visualizing the outcome of a model (explanatory)
Visualizing results both quantatively in a plot and where applicable qualitatively using examples

The best model qualitatively is the one were all the possible vectors were in use. The [SARIMA model with a rolling window](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Python-Graphs/SARIMA_Rolling_Window.png) and using real values had this statement.
This model had a `train_data = data['2016-01-01':'2017-01-01']` and a `val_data = data['2018-01-01':'2019-01-01']`.
It came out as the best predictive model for the used dataset.

XXX

## Domain Knowledge
### 1. Introduction of the subject field
~~written a good and complete introduction of subject field~~

An [introduction](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Domain_Knowledge/1._Introduction_of_the_Subject_Field.md) of the subject field within this project.

XXX

### 2. Literature Research
Found enough relevant literature and all in-text literature references and bibliography are present

All the necessary explanations of important and relevent terminology, jargon and definitions to get a better understanding of the project, can be found [here](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Domain_Knowledge/3._Explanation_of_Terminology_Jargon_and_Definitions.md).

## Data Preprocessing
### 1. Data Exploration
Properly examined and visualized data, distributions, outliers, correlations and using analysis to give directions for an early hypothesis

XXX

### 2. Data Cleansing
Cleansed data in a good and sufficient way

XXX

### 3. Data preparation
Prepared data in an appropriate way, where necessary transforming data, removing outliers, filling in missing values etc.

XXX

### 4. Data visualization
Correctly visualized data in support of decisions made for learning model

XXX

## Communication
### 1. Presentations
Prepared or gave more than two (internal/external) solid presentations

These are PowerPoints given by me:
1. [Powerpoint week 6 Monday](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Presentations/ppt_week_6.pptx)
2. [Powerpoint week 12 Friday](https://github.com/georgeottens/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Presentations/ppt_week_12_vrijdag.pptx)
3. At the 21st of January, our whole group will give a presentation for PostNL itself, to explain our reasonings and findings of the project.

### 2. Writing Paper
Made a lot of effort on writing the paper

XXX

## Link to Python Notebooks
