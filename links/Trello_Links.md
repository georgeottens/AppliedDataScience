## Most important conclusions from tickets
### Individual
The first tickets were crucial to finding compairable projects like this project, to try and see where to start working on as I had no idea.
From the first plotting tickets towards the last, I have noticed improvements relating my way of plotting and coding the dataset and the models.
My programming is not perfect, but it has gotten less and less bad as I continued to try and apply models and different validation techniques.
As the last ticket involved feedback recieved from groupmembers at the middle of the project, I have seen that I have improved my behavior and workstyle for the better.

### Collaboration
As for the collaborative tickets, I have learned to write descriptive chapters while also taking the other groupmember's opinions into account.
Learning how to give feedback to the groupmember when I found something I did not like, or recieving feedback to adapt my text to enhance it.
